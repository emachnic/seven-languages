The whole point of Mary Poppins is that she made the household better as a whole
by making it fun and changing the hearts of the people in it with passion and
imagination. You could back off a little and play it safe, using Ruby to do the
same things you already know how to do in other languages. But when you change
the way a language looks and works, you can capture magic that makes programming
fun. In this book, each chapter will show you some nontrivial problem that the
language solves well. In Ruby, that means metaprogramming.
